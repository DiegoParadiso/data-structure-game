# Data Structure Game

A fun and progressive way to learn and reinforce core data structures like **binary trees**, **hash tables**, **graphs**, and more through visual and practical exercises.

## Game Modules

### Binary Trees
- Build trees from given sequences.
- Verify properties (BST, AVL, etc.).
- Solve challenges like finding common ancestors, calculating depth, etc.

### Hash Tables
- Insert values using different hashing functions.
- Handle collisions (open addressing, chaining).
- Simulate collision attacks and optimization techniques.

### Linked Lists *(coming soon)*
- Visualize insertions, deletions, and searches.
- Challenges like detecting cycles or sorting lists.

### Daily Challenges *(coming soon)*
- A new exercise every day.
- Point system, limited attempts, and player stats.
- Practice mode for reviewing previous topics.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Mechanics**: React DnD / custom drag-and-drop
- **Backend** *(in progress)*: Node.js + MongoDB
- **Authentication** *(in progress)*: JWT-based user progress tracking
- **Graphics**: Dynamic visual representations of trees and structures

## ðŸš€ Who is this for?

- Algorithm enthusiasts
- Coding competition participants (e.g. interviews, Olympiads)
- Educators seeking engaging teaching tools
